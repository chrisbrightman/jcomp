this is a very simple autmated java project compiler writen 
perdominitly in bash scripting
this project was perdominatly impromptu and really so that I could learn more
about bash scripting

-compiles all .java files in a directory or in an src foulder and
 puts them into an out directory

-does currently support packages and subpackages

-also supports a cofig file called jcomp.conf which contains the dependancies of 
 java files

Recomended Setup:

	* compile the get-dependancies.c into a executable called get-dependacies 
	* make the jcomp file executable (standard method: chmod +x ./jcomp)
	* put the get-dependancies file and the jcomp file into a directory that
	  is in your path
	* the jcomp.conf file is optional but there will be no dependancy checking done
